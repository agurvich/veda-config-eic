    Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) is a common air pollutant primarily emitted from the burning of fossil fuels in cars and power plants. Lower to the ground, nitrogen dioxide can directly irritate the lungs and contributes to the production of particulate pollution and smog when it reacts with sunlight.
    During the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists have observed considerable decreases in nitrogen dioxide levels around the world. These decreases are predominantly associated with changing human behavior in response to the spread of COVID-19. As communities worldwide have implemented lockdown restrictions in an attempt to stem the spread of the virus, the reduction in human transportation activity has resulted in less NO₂ being emitted into the atmosphere. These changes are particularly apparent over large urban areas and economic corridors, which typically have high levels of automobile traffic, airline flights, and other related activity. NASA has observed subsequent rebounds in nitrogen dioxide levels as the lockdown restrictions ease. <br></br><br></br>
    Presented here is a monthly record of NO₂ in the troposphere, which is the lowest layer of the atmosphere most directly affected by human activity, as measured by the [Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)](https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/omi.html) on NASA’s Aura satellite since January 2016. Also included is a monthly record from January 2015 showing the change in tropospheric NO₂ from the selected month compared to the average for the same month from 2015 - 2019 (for example, difference in NO₂ between October 2023 vs October 2015 - 2019 average). This difference highlights changes in NO₂ from a baseline time frame of 2015 - 2019, just before the COVID-19 pandemic.
