    The Group on Earth Observations, a partnership of governments and international organizations, developed the Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) initiative in response to growing calls for improved agricultural information. The goal of GEOGLAM is to strengthen the international community’s capacity to produce and disseminate relevant, timely and accurate forecasts of agricultural production at national, regional and global scales through the use of Earth Observations (EO), which include satellite and ground-based observations. The GEOGLAM initiative is designed to build on existing agricultural monitoring programs and initiatives at national, regional and global levels and to enhance and strengthen them through international networking, operationally focused research, and data/method sharing.

    Presented here are GEOGLAM Crop Monitor data, which provides an international and transparent multi-source, consensus assessment of crop growing conditions, status, and agro-climatic conditions, likely to impact global production. It covers the four primary crop types (wheat, maize, rice, and soy) within the main agricultural producing regions of countries participating in the [Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS)](https://www.amis-outlook.org/amis-about/en/). These assessments have been produced operationally since September 2013 and are published in the [AMIS Market Monitor Bulletin](https://www.amis-outlook.org/index.php?id=48514). The Crop Monitor reports provide cartographic and textual summaries of crop conditions as of the 28th of each month, according to crop type. Assessments from January 2020 and onward are available to view on Earth.gov.

    ## Data Summary

      - **Temporal Extent:** January 2020 - Ongoing
      - **Temporal Resolution:** Monthly 
      - **Spatial Extent:** Global 
      - **Spatial Resolution:** 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees (~approx. 5 km)
      - **Data Units:** Crop condition classification: Exceptional, Favorable, Watch, Poor, Failure, Out of Season, No Data 
      - **Data Type:** Operational

    *Crop Condition Class Definitions:*
    - **Exceptional**: Conditions are much better than average at time of reporting, where the average is the mean conditions over the most recent 5 years. This label is used only during the grain-filling through harvest stages.
    - **Favorable**: Conditions range from slightly below to slightly above average at reporting time.
    - **Watch**: Conditions are not far from average but there is a potential risk to final yields. There is still time and possibility for the crop to recover to average conditions if the ground situation improves. This label is only used during the planting-early vegetative and the vegetative-reproductive stages.
    - **Poor**: Crop conditions are well below average. Crop yields are likely to be 5% below average. This is only used when conditions are not likely to be able to recover, and impact on yields is likely.
    - **Out of Season**: Crops are not currently planted or in development during this time.
    - **No Data**: No reliable source of data is available at this time.
