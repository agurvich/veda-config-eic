      #### Overview
      Space for Earth is a 12' x 12' x 12' immersive cube with projections on 3 walls and the floor providing a unique chance for viewers to perceive Earth from space, be immersed in NASA's Earth data and experience an interconnected and boundless world.
      This immersive installation uses real-time NASA satellite data, encouraging active engagement with Earth's transformations.

      Narrated by NASA Astronaut Dr. Andrew J. Feustel and retired NASA Astronaut Nicole Stott, the installation incorporates data from various sources, including blue Marble, Black Marble, Eyes on the Earth, MERRA-2 re-analysis, Landsat 7, ASTER, and MODIS NDVI. 

      Space For Earth is a 7 minute interactive story divided into the following chapters:

    NASA satellites provide data on Earth's land, ecosystems, water, air, temperature, and climate-- and have done so for more than 50 years. 
    Earth information from space supports decision makers, partners, and people in developing the tools needed to mitigate, adapt, and respond to our changing planet. 
    At the Earth Information Center, visitors can see how our planet is


    changing in areas that affect lives and livelihoods-- from temperatures in our cities to sea level rise, greenhouse gas emissions to agricultural productivity. 
    The center showcases large, awe-inspiring visualizations, as well as interactive media, stories and narratives, to show how viewing Earth from space can improve lives in the face of disasters, environmental challenges, and climate change.
