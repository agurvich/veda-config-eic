    Pieces of ice float in the water, mirroring the glacier's edge.
    Rocky, brown mountain peaks rise behind the ice, contrasting the icy blue with earthy tones under a cloudy sky.

    ## Info

    The impacts of sea level rise have been observed across the world.
    Hazards such as coastal flooding can pose health and safety risks for seaside residents and even displace vulnerable communities.

    At the local scale, scientists study a variety of factors that contribute to regional sea level rise including periodic change in sea level due to storm surges, ice melt, the amount of water stored on land (including rivers, lakes, and aquifers), land subsistence, and changes in water temperature and salinity.
    At the global scale, loss of ice through melting glaciers and icesheets, thermal expansion from heat trapped in oceans, and changes in the amount of water stored on land all influence the amount of change in sea level observed.
    Understanding how these factors change on a global scale also allows us to better understand changes in Earth's atmosphere and ocean.

    Using a combination space-based observations, ground-based monitoring, and modeling, Federal agencies work with local organizations across the country and internationally to prepare for and mitigate the impacts of sea level rise.
